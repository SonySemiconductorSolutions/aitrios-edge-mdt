## <div align="center">Post Processing</div>

ðŸ§® **Note:** This topic is aimed for advanced users. If this is the first time youâ€™re using Edge-MDT for converting a model to run on IMX500, it is advised not to start from this model, but from a simpler model that does not have Post Processing.

This page explains the following topics:
*	What is post processing
*	What are the considerations for running post processing on the host CPU or on the NPU (Neural Processing Unit)
*	The mechanisms that Edge-MDT offers for running post processing blocks on the NPU

### What is post processing ###
Post processing (PP) is a general term for layers or operators that are happening â€˜afterâ€™ the model. Typically layers without any trainable parameters, that are taking the output of the model and digesting it for the application.<br>
For example: models from the family of object detection use box decoding and/or NMS.

In a typical implementation of an AI feature, the inference parts run on the NPU (Neural Processing Unit) accelerator, the NPU then sends the outcome of the inference to the host CPU. The host CPU consumes that, and uses it as part of the application itself.<br>
Post processing blocks are the last part of the inference, or the early part of the application. In many cases it can just run on the host CPU and not on the NPU, but in some cases there are motivations to run it on the NPU.

In the upper part of the diagram post processing is run on the host, whereas in the lower part it is run on the NPU.

### Deciding where post processing should run ###
The Edge-MDT user needs to take an architecture decision which parts should run on the NPU, and which parts should run on the host CPU.
When taking such a decision the user should consider the following aspects:
*	The NPU is a strong accelerator for running heavy workloads in a fast and efficient manner, but it does not always support running any PP operator
*	Need to consider the load of running the PP blocks on the host CPU, as sometimes PP is a heavy computation, and the host CPU might be too weak to carry a heavy workload
*	Latency caused by running on the host CPU - a weak CPU may take significantly more time to run PP, and affect the overall latency and FPS
*	Running PP blocks on the host CPU can cause sending large amounts of data from the NPU to the CPU. Depending on the interface between the NPU and the CPU this may cause a latency hit
*	Power consumption
*	Ease of implementation

when taking into account the considerations, there could be various cases in which thereâ€™s an important benefit to run PP on the NPU.<br>
Edge-MDT offers the following options for running PP workloads on the NPU:
*	16bit quantization for selected layers â€“ by setting PP operators to run in 16bit quantization bit-width, the overall accuracy is improved, and with relatively small impact on memory size
*	Custom Layers â€“ Edge-MDT supports several common layers that can be converted to run on the IMX500 NPU.

### 16bit quantization for selected layers ###
IMX500 supports large span of layers and operators that can be converted to run on the NPU. In case the post processing is fully comprised from such building blocks, then the user can just convert them to run on the NPU. <br>
In the typical case it would mean that such layers will need to be configured to use 16bit quantization bit-width.<br>
The user can achieve it by either using the automatic mixed-precision mode of MCT, or manually set specific layers to use 16bit. For more info please refer to [MCT documentation](https://github.com/sony/model_optimization).

Note that the use of 16bit quantization for specific layers is considered an advanced feature, since the user might need to dive into the accuracy optimization of the model.

### Custom Layers ###
In case the operators that comprise the PP block cannot be converted to run on the NPU, Edge-MDT provides a set of methods that can be used. <br>
For example the following layers are available in Pytorch: NMS, NMS with indices, box decoding.<br>
Custom layer is an implementation of PP block in a way that can be converted to run on the IMX500 NPU.<br>
For example, suppose the PP phase includes Pytorch NMS layer, this layer cannot be converted to run on the NPU. The user can replace the Pytorch NMS layer with the NMS layer from the custom layer library.<br>
Using a custom layer basically means replacing a layer from the model with another layer, and typically the user would need to adjust the code to fit the Custom Layer method. This is because there are various implementations of NMS, and they are not always taking the same input, and returning the same outputs.<br>

The diagram depicts a design where post processing is run on the NPU by using a Custom Layer. The 'pre' part needs to be adjusted to run on the NPU using operators that can be converted to run on it. The Custom Layer is the last part that runs on the NPU, and the 'post' part runs already on the host CPU.

For more information on custom layers and how to use them please refer to the [custom layers documentation](https://github.com/sony/custom_layers).

Note that the use of custom layers is considered an advanced feature, since the user will need to make changes to the code of the model, find how to peel off an existing layer and replace it with the custom layer.

### Summary ###
To summarize, there are several mechanisms in Edge-MDT that the user can utilize in order to implement post processing for a specific model.
